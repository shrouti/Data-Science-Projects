# Statistical Analysis of the Effect of TV on Children's IQ Development

### Overview

This project was an econometric project I did when in graduate school. It was a  statistical research to identify if watching TV has effect on children's IQ development. The data are extracted from the publicly available NLSY79 Child data over 1986-1998 for children surveyed at least three times at ages 4-5, 6-7, and 8-9. There are 4726 observations. See data dictionary for variables included.

The project was done with SAS.

* Endogeneity
* Heteroskedasticity

### Methodology

In this project, I applied Hausman Test to identify endogenous variables, selected  instrumental variables to resolve endogeneity, used White Test to identify Heteroskedasticity problem, and made a Feasible Generalized Least Squares estimation to identify the factors that have affects on children's IQ development.
